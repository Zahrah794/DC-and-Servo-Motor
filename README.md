## Designing a Circuit for Controlled Rotation of a Servo Motor from 0 to 180 Degrees

The objective of this circuit is to control the rotation of a servo motor within a range of 0 to 180 degrees. A servo motor, a specialized type of motor widely used in robotics, automation, and remote-controlled systems, enables precise angular position control. Unlike conventional DC motors, servo motors offer exceptional accuracy and repeatability in achieving specific angular positions.

The circuit incorporates a servo motor, which comprises a DC motor coupled with a gear mechanism and a control circuit. The control circuit receives input signals, typically from a microcontroller, indicating the desired position of the servo motor. By interpreting these signals, the control circuit adjusts the motor's rotation to achieve the specified angle.

## Designing a DC Motor Circuit with L293D for Controlled Rotation

The circuit presented here involves the utilization of a DC (Direct Current) motor in conjunction with the L293D motor driver IC to achieve controlled rotation. A DC motor is an electrical device that converts direct current into mechanical motion, making it widely employed in various applications, ranging from robotics to industrial automation.

The circuit incorporates the L293D motor driver IC, which serves as a bridge between the DC motor and the control signals from an external source, typically a microcontroller. The L293D IC provides the necessary voltage and current amplification to drive the motor effectively. It also facilitates bidirectional control, allowing the motor to rotate in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
